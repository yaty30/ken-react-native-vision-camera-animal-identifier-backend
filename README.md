# Python Animal Identifier

## Overview

The **Python Animal Identifier** provides the necessary server-side functionalities to support a mobile application designed for animal identification using vision technology. This backend application processes user-uploaded images, utilizes machine learning models to identify various animal species, and returns the results in a structured format.

## Features

- **Animal Identification**: Leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to accurately identify animals from images.
- **RESTful API**: Offers a clean and efficient API for communication between the mobile app and the backend.
- **Image Processing**: Utilizes libraries like OpenCV for image manipulation and analysis.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication to protect sensitive data and ensure only authorized access.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle multiple requests simultaneously, making it suitable for production use.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Integrated logging for tracking requests and monitoring performance.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or higher
- **pip**: Python package installer
- **Flask**: For building web applications
- **OpenCV**: For image processing
- **Other dependencies**: Listed in `requirements.txt`
